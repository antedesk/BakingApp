# BakingApp Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I created the **BakingApp** app to show a list of recipes downloeaded from an online json provided by the AND cours, and the recipes details. 

## Aim of this Project
In this app, I:

- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos;
- Handle error cases in Android;
- Add a widget to your app experience;
- Leverage a third-party library in your app, such as GSON, ExoPlayer, okhttp, Calligraphy, etc;
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
